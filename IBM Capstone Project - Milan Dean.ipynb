    "## Determining Optimal Zipcodes to live in - Data Science Capstone Project\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Austin, Texas has quickly emerged as one of the fastest growing cities in America. Austinâ€™s population continues to grow, with an anticipated growth rate of 3% year over year. This is not surprising, as people are drawn to the relatively low cost of living, tech-focused industry, outdoorsy lifestyle, and year-round activities that take place in the city. Often dubbed the Silicon Valley of Texas, Austin continues to attract tech giants such as Apple, Google, Indeed and IBM - as well as many startup companies - leading to a robust job market. That combined with the attractive lifestyle that Austin presents has brought thousands of new people to the city and surrounding areas, which has had a massive effect on the real estate market. Though it continues to see positive change throughout the years, the market can be quite intimidating when it comes to deciding the right part of the city to move to, especially for those unfamiliar to the area. Whether one is looking to rent or a buy, it can be both competitive and time-consuming to find the ideal home. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, our goal is to help make this decision easier by determining optimal zip codes for people to consider when finding a new home in the Austin area. In order to achieve this, we will be utilizing Foursquare's API in order to make calls that will give us locational data on restaurants, gyms, companies, and any relevant venues in the surrounding area that could assist or hinder characteristics within the zipcode."

    "### Data Preparation and Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Data for this project was collected from [AustinTexas.gov](http://www.austintexas.gov/page/demographic-data) under the American Community Survey 2017 Profiles for ZIP Codes section. Each zipcode was a HTML download link containing an excel file holding four sheets of data. Each of the four sheets of data were categories containing data related to Demographic, Economic, Social, and Housing characteristics. Data that was labeled as necessary to include was subjective, but important features considered originated primarily from a set of survey responses to features deemed \"Important\" when considering a place to live. Because of this, not all quantifiable categories were included, and categories projected to explain a small amount of variance in potential machine learning models like race were excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "All four sheets were scraped for desired data using a program that iterates through each of the four sheets. In our excel files, our desirable features were under one column, while data related to those features were within adjacent cells. In order to fix this, the program written had to use the Series.isin() function in order to retrieve the names of the features, and their data. This program was reused for all 46 zipcodes, and for the purpose of this project, only 1 call of the program being will be shown, to save the reader time. Once each sheet had been scraped for important features I stored them along with the respective zipcode into a single dataframe to call on later."
